    <p>Welcome to your new Gatsby site.</p>
  <h2>What is Gatsby?</h2>
  </p>
Gatsby is an open-source framework that combines functionality from React, GraphQL and Webpack into a single tool for building static websites and apps. Owing to the fast performance of the sites it powers, impressive out-of-the-box features like code splitting, and friendly developer experience, Gatsby is fast becoming a staple of modern web development.</p>
    <p>Now go build something great.</p>
